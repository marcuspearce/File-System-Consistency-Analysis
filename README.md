# File-System-Consistency-Analysis

### Score: 100/100

This project deals with file systems in two parts. It first analyzes an EXT2 file system in an input image file and outputs a summary to stdout using **C**. It then takes this data as a .csv file input and detects errors and inconsistencies using **Python**. Within this project, I implemented classes for fundamental data types within the file system, as well as incorporated a dictionary/hashmap and set data structures to organize the input data for analysis. This project was unique in this course as it was relatively open-ended in terms of what approach we could take to implement it, so I had to research the benefits of using different programming languages and data structures in the context of the task. 

A description of the included files as well as sources used is documented in the README of both the lab3a and lab3b directories. For reference, the specifications for this project are given in lab3a/Project 3a.pdf and lab3b/Project 3B.pdf.

This was my implementation of Lab 3 in UCLA's CS 111 -- Operating System Principles. Taken Winter 2020.
